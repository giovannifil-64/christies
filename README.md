# Christie's

The project is aimed at the creation of a Database for Christie's, which is the largest auction house in the world and presents 12 rooms worldwide including London, New York, Paris, Geneva, Milan, Amsterdam, Dubai, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Zurich and Shanghai.

## Goals

We have created a Database that allows you to have a detailed management and continuously updated of all items for sale in the various locations, as well as an efficient control of all the warehouses and a mapping of all the locations and employees.
Project structure
The tables allow us to have the information we need from the database; there are 8 tables in which the following information is recorded:
- admin
- auctions
- employees
- offices
- sellers
- users
- objects
- features

The information contained in the tables cannot be changed by all the users but only from a category of authorized users.
The web part is used by the generic user to work on the database and receive
quickly all the necessary information; there will be different levels of users to ensure data security.
We have identified 2 levels of users:
- Administrator : Ability to add objects , creation of new ones users, insertion of new employees
- Employee : Possibility to add objects.
It follows to the description of the project the drafting of the conceptual design, the logical design and then physical design.
